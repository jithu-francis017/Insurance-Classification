# Insurance Classification

Welcome to my Insurance Customer Prediction repository! This project uses Python code and Jupyter Notebook to predict whether a customer takes insurance or not, based on demographic and policy information from the insurance.csv dataset. We will employ machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to analyze the data. The results will assist insurance companies in targeting potential customers and improving their marketingÂ strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the insurance_data.csv file, which contains information about customers whether they have insurance or not.

## Analysis

We will use various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict whether a customer takes insurance or not. The following algorithms will be employed:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

We will compare the accuracy of these algorithms to determine which one is most effective at predicting whether a customer takes insurance or not.

## Results

The results of our analysis will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. We will include visualizations to help interpret the data, as well as detailed explanations of the results of each algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the latest version of Jupyter Notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/jithu-francis017/Insurance-Classification.git
```

Then, navigate to the repository directory and open the `LogisticRegression.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
